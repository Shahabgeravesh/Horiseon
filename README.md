# Horiseon
Given the Horiseon website, we strive to refactor the code in a way that follows the accessibility standars so that the website is optimized for search engines. We adjusted the following on the website: 

Links are functioning properly
Consolidated the CSS selectors and properties 
Added alt attributes to the images 
Headings are in sequential order
Added a title for the web page 
Changed  <div> to semantic HTML elements 
improved the elements to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
